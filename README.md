# Driver Drowsiness Detection

## Overview

Driver Drowsiness Detection is a computer vision project that uses machine learning to detect and count the blinks of a car driver. It also provides warnings if the driver appears to be falling asleep or has fainted while driving. This project aims to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by drowsy or inattentive drivers.

## Features

- Real-time detection of driver blinks using computer vision techniques.
- Monitoring of the driver's eye movements and alerting if drowsiness is detected.
- Warning notifications to prevent potential accidents.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib
- Machine Learning (for blink detection)
- Real-time image processing
- Your specific technology or libraries

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to start the driver drowsiness detection system.

## Usage

- Launch the system.
- The program will access the camera feed.
- The system will detect the driver's eyes and monitor their blinks.
- If drowsiness or inattention is detected, warnings will be provided to the driver.
